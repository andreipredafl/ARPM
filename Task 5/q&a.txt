Exercise 1 

The code schedueles a command every hour by using laravel scheduele system.
This makes it to not overlap if there is any other instance already active.
onOneServer makes it to run only on one server to not process same thing many times
runInBackground as the name says, runs in background :)

Exercise 2 

Coontext is used to the curent state of the thing, like auth()->user, app()->getLocale, 
or even setting custom ones
The main difference is that context is used for one request only and cache for many requests on
a specific lifetime or forever. Other difference is that the context is in memory and cache
can be set via Redis, File, DB, etc. Laravel already suports cache but not context.
Both are temporary.

Exercise 3
$query->update() does not trigger events and does not update created_at/updated_at
$model->update() does all of above
$model->updateQuietly() is somehow a prototype, is a $model->update()  that does not
trigger the events but updated the created_at/updated_at columns
$model->update() and $model->updateQuietly() also interact with the appends in models
